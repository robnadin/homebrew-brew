# Custom Homebrew Tap

This is a custom Homebrew tap for older formulas.

## Setup

You can add the custom tap in a MacOS terminal session using:

```
$ brew tap robnadin/brew
```

For example:

 * Install the latest 2.44.x production release of librsvg:
   ```
   $ brew install librsvg@2.44
   ```

## Installing Formulae

Once the tap has been added locally, you can install individual software packages with:

```
$ brew install <formula>
```

## Additional Information

This tap was created using the Homebrew documentation on [How to Create and Maintain a tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md).

You can find additional information in the [Homebrew project README](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew#homebrew).
